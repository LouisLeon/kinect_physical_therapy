\section{Purpose}
The purpose of the Kinect Based Physical Therapy Solution project is to provide a solution for physical therapy patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease to perform in-home therapy exercises. This solution will not only allow for an interactive way of completing a patient's required home therapy but will provide a way for their physical therapist to track their progress and monitor their exercises.

\section{Goals}
Our project will have a simple UI that can be easily navigated by a user with Parkinson's Disease. From the UI, the user will be able to select the option that allows them to select and do the available exercises. Our goal is to have two different exercises available to the user to choose from. One of our stretch goals is to be able to have a physical therapist prescribe exercises and specify frequency. The program will guide the user through these exercises using text and verbal instructions. One of our stretch goals is to implement visual (graphical) cues (over-laying their body on the camera feed) to the user to guide them through exercises. As the user performs exercises, their node data will be collected to be sent to their physical therapist as a .csv file, and it will be used for report generation. We will define the exercise's correct movements and compare them to the user's node data. This is how we will analyze the data to determine user accuracy for report generation. Another option the user will be able to select is report generation. This will display the user's performance data in graphs and charts, showing their progress with the exercises over time. 

\section{Current Project State}
We began looking through the Microsoft Kinect SDK (version 2.0) early Winter term to familiarize ourselves with some of the API calls and data structures. Fortunately, the SDK provides some sample programs and templates which help developers understand Kinect features and the workflow for creating an application. We used the sample programs to our advantage and began merging them into one cohesive solution. Our main user interface is constructed using XAML (Extensible Application Markup Language). Our main landing page in our user interface currently has some of the following pages: Engagement and Cursor Settings, Exercises, and a display test page. The settings page is where the user can specify how to begin engaging with the Kinect Sensor. There are three different settings that the user can choose from: System Default (hold open hand still in front of sensor), raised arms above head, and any hand detected on screen \cite{KinectDevelop}.

The exercise menu option leads the user to a page that shows a Kinect camera feed and tracks their body. It uses node data to draw joints and bones over the user's image on the camera feed. It also visually indicates whether the user has their hands open, closed, or  loop (closed fist with index finger pointed out). Semi-transparent red circles indicate closed fists, green indicates open hands, and blue indicates loops. This page also indicates when the user is out of the Kinect sensor bounds by displaying a semi-transparent, red border line.

\section{Conclusion}
At this point, we are putting all of our efforts into implementing gesture recognition for the exercises. Until we are able to successfully implement this, the rest of the project will have nothing to be built on. Luckily, the Kinect SDK and Vitruvius makes it trivial to analyze the accuracy of the user's movements, so we are expecting report generation to take much less effort than we had initially thought it would. Based on our schedule, we are on track to having a beta product by the end of this term.
