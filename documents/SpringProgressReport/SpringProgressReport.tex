\section{Purpose}
The purpose of the Kinect Based Physical Therapy Solution project is to provide a solution for physical therapy patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease to perform in-home therapy exercises. This solution will not only allow for an interactive way of completing a patient's required home therapy but will provide a way for their physical therapist to track their progress and monitor their exercises.

\section{Goals}
Our project will have a simple UI that can be easily navigated by a user with Parkinson's Disease. From the UI, the user will be able to select the option that allows them to select and do the available exercises. Our goal is to have two different exercises available to the user to choose from. One of our stretch goals is to be able to have a physical therapist prescribe exercises and specify frequency. The program will guide the user through these exercises using text and verbal instructions. One of our stretch goals is to implement visual (graphical) cues (over-laying their body on the camera feed) to the user to guide them through exercises. As the user performs exercises, their node data will be collected to be sent to their physical therapist as a .csv file, and it will be used for report generation. We will define the exercise's correct movements and compare them to the user's node data. This is how we will analyze the data to determine user accuracy for report generation. Another option the user will be able to select is report generation. This will display the user's performance data in graphs and charts, showing their progress with the exercises over time. 

\section{Current Project State}
We began looking through the Microsoft Kinect SDK (version 2.0) early Winter term to familiarize ourselves with some of the API calls and data structures. Fortunately, the SDK provides some sample programs and templates which help developers understand Kinect features and the workflow for creating an application. We used the sample programs to our advantage and began merging them into one cohesive solution. Our main user interface is constructed using XAML (Extensible Application Markup Language). Our main landing page in our user interface currently has some of the following pages: Engagement and Cursor Settings, Exercises, and a display test page. The settings page is where the user can specify how to begin engaging with the Kinect Sensor. There are three different settings that the user can choose from: System Default (hold open hand still in front of sensor), raised arms above head, and any hand detected on screen \cite{KinectDevelop}.

The exercise menu option leads the user to a page that shows a Kinect camera feed and tracks their body. It uses node data to draw joints and bones over the user's image on the camera feed. It also visually indicates whether the user has their hands open, closed, or  loop (closed fist with index finger pointed out). Semi-transparent red circles indicate closed fists, green indicates open hands, and blue indicates loops. This page also indicates when the user is out of the Kinect sensor bounds by displaying a semi-transparent, red border line. 

\section{Problems Impeding Progress and Solutions}
\subsection{Body Tracking Latency}
\subsection{Data Collection Customization}
\subsection{User Interface}
\subsection{Report Generation}
Some of the difficulties we faced while developing the report generation portion of this project were design and requirements related. We knew that we wanted a page in the software which had the purpose of generating reports based on the exercises that the user completes. We also knew that the page had to read in some arbitrary amount of data that was stored somewhere locally that was related to the user. We had the issue of deciding where and how to store this data locally and how to access it for the purposes of generating some visual report for the client and user to see. Initially, our data was being collected during each of the available exercises. The data would be written into a .txt file during the exercise session and written to that file in an unspecified order. The issue came with being able to read the file successfully enough and parse the data needed to generate some form of usable chart. 

We were also unsure of which data would be useful to the user and how to present it in an easily digestible format. Our solution was to change the manner in which the user and report data was collected during the exercise session by switching the format to a .csv file or comma separated values. This allows us to continually write to a file that corresponds with the current exercise. This continuous record can be dynamically plotted within the program's view using a library called \textit{OxyPlot}\cite{OxyPlot}. 

Within our code, we made some plot model classes and .csv reading classes that read in the user exercise data and restructure it to match the required format for the plotting library. This also allows a user to choose which exercise they wish to see their generated reports with. The reports draw graphs that display data such as the date of their exercise and the time it took to complete a specific exercise. A patient or their physical therapist can monitor performance over time or see the limb angles achieved during a session.

\section{Remaining Tasks}
\subsection{Node Clipping}
One of our remaining tasks for this project is to fix an issue with our visual skeleton drawings. Our software allows the user to see themselves along with an overlaid image of several body joints and nodes. There are also some drawn lines that are associated with the user's limbs and spine. These shapes are all drawn simultaneously once the Kinect Sensor determines there to be a human body in front of the camera. 

There may be some times where the Kinect Sensor is pointed at an angle such that it does not see the user's lower body within its visual scope. This leads to the associated lower body lines and joint shapes to be clipped and appear non-connecting. This issue disappears once the user's entire body enters the frame and is recognized by the sensor. 

Unfortunately, this behavior is caused by the library we are using to help us draw all of the main shapes needed as well as some angle visualizations. It makes the process lighter and simpler than using the built-in Kinect methods which requires more setup in the code portions. One solution is to resort back to the built-in methods only to draw the overlaid body lines and joints while using the installed Vitruvius library to do the rest.
\section{Relevant Project Information}


\section{Conclusion}
At this point, we are putting all of our efforts into implementing gesture recognition for the exercises. Until we are able to successfully implement this, the rest of the project will have nothing to be built on. Luckily, the Kinect SDK and Vitruvius makes it trivial to analyze the accuracy of the user's movements, so we are expecting report generation to take much less effort than we had initially thought it would. Based on our schedule, we are on track to having a beta product by the end of this term.
