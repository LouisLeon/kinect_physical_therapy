\section{Purpose}
The purpose of the Kinect Based Physical Therapy Solution project is to provide a solution for physical therapy patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease to perform in-home therapy exercises. This solution will not only allow for an interactive way of completing a patient's required home therapy but will provide a way for their physical therapist to track their progress and monitor their exercises.

\section{Goals}
Our project will have a simple UI that can be easily navigated by a user with Parkinson's Disease. From the UI, the user will be able to select the option that allows them to select and do the available exercises. Our goal is to have two different exercises available to the user to choose from. One of our stretch goals is to be able to have a physical therapist prescribe exercises and specify frequency. The program will guide the user through these exercises using text and verbal instructions. One of our stretch goals is to implement visual (graphical) cues (over-laying their body on the camera feed) to the user to guide them through exercises. As the user performs exercises, their node data will be collected to be sent to their physical therapist as a .csv file, and it will be used for report generation. We will define the exercise's correct movements and compare them to the user's node data. This is how we will analyze the data to determine user accuracy for report generation. Another option the user will be able to select is report generation. This will display the user's performance data in graphs and charts, showing their progress with the exercises over time. 

\section{Project Introduction}
\subsection{Project Information}
The Kinect Based Physical Therapy project was requested by the OSU Healthcare Systems Engineering Lab, specifically by our client Dr. Mehmet Serdar Kilinc. The Healthcare System Engineering Lab in OSU is a research center which focuses on innovative non-traditional healthcare models, information technology healthcare interventions, and translational research. The lab is currently focusing on research projects that require sensor-based healthcare solutions. This project was specifically focused on using a Microsoft Kinect Sensor with the assumption being it could be useful for in-home health monitoring applications.

The importance of this project was to demonstrate a proof of concept that helps people with neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's Disease get access to physical therapy remotely without the need for in-person therapy sessions. Access to physical therapy clinics is problematic due to physical disability that inhibits traveling and can be costly for patients. Non-wearable sensor-based solutions have the potential to reduce the number of in-person visits and the long-distance traveling that is required. 

\subsection{Team Members}
The two members of the development team for this project were Louis Leon and San Dim Ciin, two senior Computer Science students at Oregon State University. They both held the role as lead developers for this project. Each team member had large tasks in all the components of the project which ranged from building the user interface to automating the report generation process. The project's client, Dr. Kilinc supervised the project's direction and progress. He provided feedback at various stages of the development process and requested features that could serve as additions to the project overall.

\subsection{Structure and Operation}
The directory structure of the project itself includes separate directories for Gestures, Navigation Pages, User Data, Exercise Pages, and Libraries. 

The user interface consists of a main navigation page which allows the user to choose one of three of the following tiles or pages to navigate to: Exercises, Reports, and Settings. Each page has several components and libraries that correspond to it. 

Each exercise option has a dedicated .cs file where the exercise is defined and a corresponding .xaml file for the graphics display. In the exercise files, the Kinect Sensor is initialized along with the exercise gestures, node recorder, and timer. With the use of an open source Kinect library, Vitruvius, the setup for the sensor is greatly simplified. 

The Reports page within the main navigation screen houses the report generation logic. Using a plotting library called OxyPlot, each CSV file containing the user's exercise data for every completed exercise session is processed and plotted onto the display.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  CONCLUSIONS AND REFLECTIONS  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Conclusions and Reflections}
\begin{flushleft}
{\large\textbf{Louis Leon}\par}
\textbf{What technical information did you learn?}\par
From working on this capstone project, I have learned a lot about programming in the C\# language and using the Kinect SDK to write code that interfaces with the Kinect Sensor architecture. I also learned about using native .NET Framework libraries to access system file paths in order to read and write to files that were essential for the project. I learned more about the Kinect Sensor than I had expected and learned to appreciate the potential of the applications that can be made possible using such a piece of technology. Learning how to develop custom gestures for the Microsoft Kinect was one of my favorite parts of the project. 

\textbf{What non-technical information did you learn?}\par
With the non-technical side of the project, I learned more about neurodegenerative diseases and Parkinson's disease and how they affect the human body as well as why we need certain technologies to help those who suffer from those types of diseases. I learned how physical therapy is used with someone who has Parkinson's disease and what symptoms to look for in a patient. I also gained some experience about what it was like to work on a project with a small team and a client who was expecting and requesting certain requirements of us.

\textbf{What have you learned about project work?}\par
I learned that project work can be extremely rewarding and even more insightful than regular coursework. I learned more about coding in a new language and software development techniques than I have in most courses. I also learned that doing extensive research for a project of this size is essential for doing well and creating a good final product. Also, I experienced what it was like to be able to use existing resources to help develop parts of the project. This allowed us to develop faster without adding any extra complexity to the project and not worrying about debugging that area of the project.

\textbf{What have you learned about project management?}\par
I found that I was able to apply some software engineering skills and other tools learned earlier during my undergraduate courses. The non-technical side of the project was what made development easier and more organized. Researching the topics and libraries used during development was critical because we were able to plan ahead and decide which technology we wanted to implement and how to implement it. I also learned more about the importance of requirement gathering with a client. We wanted to implement as closely to what our client had asked of us and what we thought to be achievable. 

\textbf{What have you learned about working in teams?}\par
When working in teams, I learned how important it was to plan ahead and stay organized and on top of my tasks because some of my work could be required in order to start on other members’ tasks. It was also very beneficial to work together on tasks in person because it motivated me to stay on task and make more progress on the project than it would to work separately. 

\textbf{If you could do it all over, what would you do differently?}\par

\end{flushleft}

{\large\textbf{San Dim Ciin}\par}
\textbf{What technical information did you learn?}\par
The Microsoft Kinect, along with the .NET framework required to use it, is a technology I was completely new to developing with. To create the user interface, we used Windows Presentation Foundation. This required learning how to write the xaml files to produce the visual aspect of the interface, and I learned how to write C\# code to implement the functionality of the interface. In addition to learning the inner workings of each language, I also learned how to make the visual and functional pieces of the code interact with each other. All of the Kinect functionality was written in the backend portion in C\#. I learned about the many classes in the Kinect SDK that allowed us implement body tracking, gesture recognition, and skeleton display.

\textbf{What non-technical information did you learn?}\par
In addition to the technical information that I learned, I learned about telehealth, physical therapy, and Parkinson's Disease. The product we developed would fit under the category of telehealth, which uses technology to make healthcare more accessible and affordable. Telehealth services can be used to access test results, monitor blood sugar levels, schedule appointments, record physical activity, and much more. When observing a physical therapy session, I learned about various techniques in physical therapy and the meaning behind the way one's body performs actions. For example, when one's stride is short, it means they are struggling with dorsiflexion (the movement of the foot upwards, so that the foot is closer to the shin). I also learned about the causes, symptoms, and treatments of Parkinson's Disease. PD patients exhibit tremors, slow movement, and stiffness, among many other symptoms, due to a disorder of the central nervous system that mainly affects the motor system. 

\textbf{What have you learned about project work?}\par
The main thing I learned about project work is that it is unpredictable. Despite the careful planning and schedule of development, there will always be obstacles that delay our progress. Development requires research of different technologies that we may have not used before, resulting in a learning period and many iterations of trial and error. I also learned the importance of modularization in a project. There were several pieces of our project that went through constant changes. Writing modular code made it possible to keep those changes local and maintain functionality in the project as a whole. Because there were so many frequent changes, I learned that frequent commits to the project repository are necessary for allowing group mates to contribute and make progress on the project. My knowledge of git has increased because of this.

\textbf{What have you learned about project management?}\par
When managing a project, it is important to have long term and short term goals. I learned that long term goals were necessary for evaluating the product and progress made at significant milestones, and short term goals were necessary to keep the team on track and working at a reasonable pace to reach the goals at the milestones. With these goals in mind, I also learned that the schedule of development must be revised when obstacles are encountered that delay progress. When this happens, short term goals change to account for lost time in order to reach the long term goals.

\textbf{What have you learned about working in teams?}\par
In the case of working on a student project, a major aspect of group work is coordinating schedules. Because there was limited overlapping availability, we had to be diligent with planning our meetings ahead of time so that we wouldn't miss opportunities to work together. We would meet at most three times a week, so we had a set of tasks to complete for each session to keep us on track. The benefit of working in groups is being able to allocate tasks to each member. We had to have a level of trust in each other to complete tasks that we worked on individually. This allowed us to be focused on our task and ask the other for help when we needed it. With this dynamic, we were able to make consistent progress and put our energy into doing our part instead of babysitting the other group mate.

\textbf{If you could do it all over, what would you do differently?}\par
If I could do it all over, I would begin development much sooner. This would have allowed a buffer for setbacks and time for learning of new technologies. I also would have made the plan for the final product much more concrete at the very beginning. While we were able to accomplish everything laid out in our documents, I was still unsure about what would please our client throughout the process. The requirements given to us by our client weren't very strict or specific, so we had a bit of freedom with what we wanted to implement. Because of this, I never had a solid idea of what a final product should be.
