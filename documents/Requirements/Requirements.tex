            The purpose of this document is to define and describe a possible solution for physical therapists to utilize when monitoring a patient's prescribed therapeutic movement set. The solution involves the use of a Kinect sensor to track a patient's movements when performing exercises. The data that the sensor records will be stored and sent to their physical therapist to allow them to monitor their patient's progress. The task is to develop software that includes an interface for patients and physical therapists to interact with. Pre-defined exercises will be implemented in the software and compared against a patient's movements to determine the accuracy of the therapy. The project will be completed once a working prototype is prepared and the clients' requirements are satisfied. The document is structured into three sections which provide a high-level description of the problem, solution, and performance metrics.
