\section{Purpose}
The purpose of the Kinect Based Physical Therapy Solution project is to provide a solution for physical therapy patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease perform in-home therapy exercises. This solution will not only allow for an interactive way of completing a patient's required home therapy but will provide a way for their physical therapist to track their progress and monitor their exercises.

\section{Goals}
The goal of this project is to implement the main functions of the product. A user interface should be developed that allows users to interact with the program. The interface will allow them to select exercises from a menu, hear and read instructions that guide them through exercises, and receive feedback during exercise to encourage proper movements. We will also implement the function to export node data to a .csv file. Physical therapists should be able to set the frequency and duration of data collection. Physical therapists should also be able to view a data summary/report of the patients' data.

\section{Problems Impeding Progress and Solutions}

\section{Current Project State}
The project is now ready to move on to the implementation stage. Fall term was mainly focused on planning and designing the product. We met with our client to clarify the functionality of the product and what features need to be implemented. We now have an idea of what to implement and how to implement them.
